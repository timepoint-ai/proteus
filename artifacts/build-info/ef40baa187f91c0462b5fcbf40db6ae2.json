Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"}},\"title\":\"GenesisNFT\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/src/GenesisNFT.sol\":\"GenesisNFT\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x6ead281d4569c26b3dee7313aefff24add906f3600b57d8aef1255a17d6b34e5\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://aec0f9c9f14f829353663e1946bf0ea00a1771ff6ddb4f7cbe14893397b4b55c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVMR3SdijdM2BpL9Yp3u7Riaxqgs1FnZ1Rfg2CMjKGtVS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf78f05f3b8c9f75570e85300d7b4600d7f6f6a198449273f31d44c1641adb46f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e28b872613b45e0e801d4995aa4380be2531147bfe2d85c1d6275f1de514fba3\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeeFcfShHYaS3BdgVj78nxR28ZaVUwbvr66ud8bT6kzw9\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x88cd5e3bee2e8c36b8d9058fbcaa81ad5704281b25634122234b55ea853d8055\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8dc7e7ab5b8ea36c15027ab04221b05d1c970f47a53e9fd47ead8ca665d49c7e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmeeph7fsDyfRr8vb2L8KcDEmKPb224TAayMvgqgGAnqpL\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe85bdcbce4b8474872045aafb5ed8e3e0a5bd794ded35f76ee9deef25bdc7446\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://60872f2d516e70f06d9684386c6b9c0b9d7ff7f4af257be6087efa2c3bb81937\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmdWgPbs2e8SFNNXPFwTt2xD5N8hniehgGCMHUnY1JDcCw\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Enumerable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xaa3852717be1903bf8b8a66c7ce323f70ac93227769c450f2b332fdd16bd9198\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://09ce2e4a5b1064a392594c0d5efeb3ccd8eacf431e55a85574cafb6bfb72ba69\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmUbT5UomYpwwMrNMzzuNcGb4sxuMZ4jz8mMPZewX8mEPn\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf46268c37522320bb2119a5a394bc5c739a95c0c574c8d08e8c643f4d06e5c76\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://517e4b295f35b9947c72ad7379a6089439ece7bb6f4a2ea0a159da13046c039e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZXzkSfLUbvujig3zVbpDHykpHhqLpvQtdiN3B5j4TA3u\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/utils/ERC721Utils.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc2dfdc8fbc8fdb142575c90568e237b809a1feaccff23e32d00131887a08dc36\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://dbc1d283ee77da43d61661b5ba1adeb427d6a6224335494a9a857dce41d9f1d6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTnA35z7XzkxFSRUqB6CGVH1nhmvajwnDNfA5PiKmYuCi\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Base64.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xed82055e8e44241f0f55892198960452018fa743e419ba469a2583c43103965a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://07187a5099b0d5ddc124f9e6e287063795096c3f46a61563e3b6f6def88958b2\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSkxuUbThjVLpQmP4TW1LibWEVpXShsn3mSsXuWZVetL4\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Panic.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf7fe324703a64fc51702311dc51562d5cb1497734f074e4f483bfb6717572d7a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c6a5ff4f9fd8649b7ee20800b7fa387d3465bd77cf20c2d1068cd5c98e1ed57a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVSaVJf9FXFhdYEYeCEfjMVHrxDh5qL4CGkxdMWpQCrqG\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xad148d59f05165f9217d0a9e1ac8f772abb02ea6aaad8a756315c532bf79f9f4\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://15e3599867c2182f5831e9268b274b2ef2047825837df6b4d81c9e89254b093e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZbL7XAYr5RmaNaooPgZRmcDXaudfsYQfYD9y5iAECvpS\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x2d9dc2fe26180f74c11c13663647d38e259e45f95eb88f57b61d2160b0109d3e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://81233d1f98060113d9922180bb0f14f8335856fe9f339134b09335e9f678c377\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWh6R35SarhAn4z2wH8SU456jJSYL2FgucfTFgbHJJN4E\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8891738ffe910f0cf2da09566928589bf5d63f4524dd734fd9cedbac3274dd5c\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://971f954442df5c2ef5b5ebf1eb245d7105d9fbacc7386ee5c796df1d45b21617\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmadRjHbkicwqwwh61raUEapaVEtaLMcYbQZWs9gUkgj3u\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x1225214420c83ebcca88f2ae2b50f053aaa7df7bd684c3e878d334627f2edfc6\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6c5fab4970634f9ab
